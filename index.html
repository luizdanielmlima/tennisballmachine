            After seeing this video on Youtube I was excited to build a tennis
            ball machine. But I knew it wouldn´t be easy. I researched some ways
            to launch the ball and I decided to use the 2-wheel principle. It
            was during this time that I decided on the motors, components and
            materials I would use.

                Definitely this was the most "brain intensive" step, where I had
                to detail every part of the machine, according to the available
                resources. I´ve also bought some commercial parts, such as the

                After I finished building and testing if the ball was being
                launched correctly (I had to put some overgrip on the wheels!),
                I learned some Arduino to program the ball feeder. At this time
                I also dissasembled the entire machine (ugh!) to paint every
                part and then assemble it back.

            Well, it was quite an adventure to build this machine! As every
            hobbist know, it always seem easier than it is ;-) Of course I
            thought about quitting many times - but I kept on trying, fixing,
            re-building , until I got it working. In the end it was a great
            project to learn new things: woodwork, arduino, painting and much
            more. Was it worth it? Definitely!
